# Short Quiz Mania
Short Quiz Mania is a quiz project that helps the students to take part in quizes of different subjects. For the sake of this project I have added 4 subjects for quizes for the time being. But it will be updated very soon.

This website is made by using React Router DOM. and for styling I have used bootstrap and some custom css. By click the nav links the website redirects to the respected url. All the data are fetched from API ans display on UI. For the right and wrong answers we have added React Toastify for better user experience. 

## Project Features
- The project shows different quiz subjects with some of the question for each subject
- If any student clicks on a answer then a toaster will appear and display whether the answer is right or wrong.
- By clicking on the eye icon that is located on the right side of each question one can see the correct answer easily.
- Besides the project contains the statistics chart that shows the number of question respected to the subject name.
- If someone clicks on the blog section then the url redirects him/her to some of the frequently asked questions that we got.
- the website also shows the active route with a different color on the nav bar. so that user can understand which route he/she is visiting
- By clicking on the about link the user we find the courses that we provide. They can also find the course instructors details.
- If someone wants to visit a route which is not assigned then an error message will be shown.
